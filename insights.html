					 <p class = "article_subtext"> by, Fortune Felix </p>

					 <div class = "article">
<p> Sometime last year in the office, our head truck driver, Jafaru said, <i> "Maigida ya nemo kudi, ya kuma samu kudin" </i> (Oga looked for money and he made the money). </p> 
<p> He then began sharing war-stories of how hard our boss worked in the early years, jumping from one trailer park/garage to another selling trailer spare parts and making contacts, to working tirelessly in the shop from can’t see in the morning to can’t see in the night.
He is a Naira billionaire today. Basically, He first leveraged <b> hard work, street credibility, experience, international assets cultivated over the years to build capital </b>, and then used <b> capital to scale </b>. That model worked powerfully in his era. </p> 
<p> But in today’s economy, while the same principles still matter, the landscape has shifted. </p>
<p> You see, Wealth creation relies on three key forms of leverage:</p>
<ul>
<li> The <b> first leverage is labour/hard work </b>. It is the oldest form of leverage, yourself and others working really hard for long, grueling hours. In today’s modern economy, how hard you work matters a lot less. This is the worst form of leverage that you could possibly use. </li>
<li> The <b> second form of leverage is CAPITAL </b>. Capital is a modern form of leverage; it is the one people have used to get fabulously rich in the past decades. It scales very, very well. </li> 
</ul>
<p> 
The final form of leverage is brand new, and it is probably the most powerful form leverage. It is: <b> PRODUCTS WITH NO MARGINAL COST OF REPLICATION </b>, and what are these products, 
<ol>
<li> Media/Content </li>
<li> Code </li>
</ol>
</p>

<p> The Almanack of Naval Ravikant, describes code as the most powerful form of permisionless leverage, since it mined our current crop of billionaires (Bill Gates, Larry Page, Jeff Bezos, Mark).  Media and Content is fast becoming as powerful as code.</p>
<p> These form of leverage are permissionless, as you don’t need anyone’s permission to use them or succeed. <b> With the right content marketing/social media strategy you can sell anything, to millions of people across borders </b>. </p> 
<h5> REALITY CHECK: </h5>
<p> How many hours of work could the wife of that Uber driver put in, or how much capital could be invested in that business, that would deliver the same return on investment as that single piece of content created by Emeka Nobis ? </p>
<p> Do you think the daughter of say Abdulsamad Rabiu, with all the capital and effort at her disposal, could have generated the same cultural impact Hilda Baci  did a few weeks ago? </p>
<p> And this is why, despite his wealth and influence, Tony Elumelu  remains active on social media, creating content, sharing insights, and deliberately leveraging media to strengthen his brand. </p>
<p> Elon Musk, though the wealthiest man in the world, still invests time on Twitter/X, creating content, bantering, and shaping conversations.
The primary reason Donald J. Trump  won the 2024 US Elections.
This is why that futurist and visionary, Chidomere Ndubuisi  is building Pamtech Group not just on their renowned excellence in auto-service delivery, but on the <b>powerful leverage of content and media </b> 
As a Small and medium scale enterprise or business owner in Nigeria, the odds are stacked against you. You are playing a losing game already. 
Your <b> strongest play is to leverage content and media marketing. A single well-crafted piece of content, backed by consistent strategy, can multiply your efforts and help take your business to the next level </b> </p>
